    Hello. Welcome to my digital abode.
  </p>
  <p>
    My name is Valdemaras Repsys. My ultimate goal in life is to see the pale blue dot from a distance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that we know each other...
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm starting this homepage as an experiment in minimalism, a little protest against digital monoculture, 
    and most importantly, an attempt so start writing more.
  <p>
    Below you will find a list of my humble attempts to share my thoughts.
