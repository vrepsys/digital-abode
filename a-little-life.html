        <h1>A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara</h1>
        <p>
            A Little Life has pages that fill your heart with compassion, kindness, sadness. It also kicks-off your eye
            hydration protocols against your will at certain points during the journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, there were things in the book that made me feel uncomfortable, and even annoyed, that I
            wanted to rip the book apart, bin it, and remove it from the memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't remember feeling so ambivalent a book the way I felt about A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. Some
            would argue this is a sign of a good book, and I would probably agree.
        </p>
        <p>
            The book starts by telling a seemingly inconspicuous story of four friends in New York City. But soon enough
            it engulfs the reader into an avalanche of events that involve childhood sexual abuse, trauma, self-harm,
            but also friendship, kindness, and love.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hanya Yanagihara delves deep into the psyche and internal dialogue of the main protagonist (who's name is
            Jude). I enjoyed a deeply introspective way the author explores and reveals inner workings of Jude's and his
            friends' minds.
        </p>
        <p>
            The author takes the concepts of friendship, kindness, and trauma to staggering extremes (both positive and
            negative extremes). I appreciated that it opened the window for me to reflect on my own experiences,
            relationships, and feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Jude's internal dialogs, I could recognise what a therapist would probably identify as negative thought
            patterns and limiting beliefs. Knowing there's so much research and science into how these sort of issues
            can alleviated, I felt saddened by his blatant refusal to seek professional help. Even when Jude becomes a
            successful, influential, and rich lawyer (obviously he is a highly intelligent person), he chooses to
            continue his suffering and refuses to be helped. I found his choice annoying, but I can also understand how
            difficult it can be to face the monsters of your mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, all 4 of the friends become successful, rich, and sophisticated members of society — which at times
            felt slightly cliché-ish and at certain moments I felt like I was watching a telenovela (albeit not a bad
            one).
        </p>
        <p>
            One other thing that I found unusual and shocking at the same time was the level of detail with which the
            experience and the suffering of childhood sexual abuse was revealed. The book is very successful in making
            the reader feel uncomfortable. The grotesque details started me thinking if there's anything that can be
            done to make sure this never happens. To anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            So naturally, I was slightly disappointed that it never occurred to Jude to go back to the institutions
            where he's suffered the abuse and make sure no other child is hurt. He is a successful lawyer, and a
            privileged member of society after all. The book, however, doesn't touch upon broader societal issues. I get
            it. This book is not about that. It's a story of suffering, and a story of friendship and kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
            A rollercoaster worth taking.
